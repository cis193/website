# Homework 7: Web Scraping

## Task

Use web scraping via the goquery package to extract data from web pages. You
will almost certainly need to refer to the [goquery documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery).

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in the [`hw7.go`](/~cis193/homeworks/hw7.go) code file stub.

Make sure that your code does not result in hanging goroutines or abusive web
scraping behavior. Static analysis tools like `go vet` may help.

Be sure that your code is run through `gofmt` and compiles successfully before
submitting. You will be learning many Go best practices throughout the semester
that you will be expected to follow.

## Submitting

You should submit your `hw7.go`
to [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1350686) when you are done.

**NOTE:** Please submit *only* the completed `hw7.go` file, nothing else.
