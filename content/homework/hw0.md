# Homework 0: Hello Go!

## Task

Install Go, be familiar with the toolchain, and become familiar writing Go
programs and running them on your machine.

## Installing Go

First, you should install Go onto your machine with the instructions provided at
the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install). Be sure to follow the
instructions under the **Test your installation** header, particularly setting
your `GOPATH`.

Once you are done, you should be able to create the `hello.go` program shown and
run it on your personal machine.

For this class, we will be using Go >= 1.6. If you're having difficulties
installing Go on your machine, we suggest using a Linux virtual machine or using
ENIAC to run your programs.


## Editor Configuration

While this is not required, we highly recommend that you configure your editor
environment for Go early on. There are numerous Go packages, for nearly every
editor, including
[vim](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go),
[emacs](https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el),
[Atom](https://atom.io/packages/go-plus),
[VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go), and 
[Sublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime).

These plugins will greatly increase your efficiency by automatically running
`gofmt`, automatically including imports through `goimports`, and catching
errors early.


## Beginner Exercises

Once you have installed Go and configured your editor, you should complete the
exercises in the [`hw0.go`](/~cis193/homeworks/hw0.go) code file stub.

Be sure that your code is run through `gofmt` and compiles successfully before
submitting. You will be learning many Go best practices throughout the semester
that you will be expected to follow.


## Submitting

You should submit your `hw0.go` to Canvas when you are done. The Canvas page is
not up yet (as of January 16), this assignment will be updated as soon as the
assignment is created.

**NOTE:** Please submit *only* the completed `hw0.go` file, nothing else.
