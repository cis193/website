# Homework 2: Object Oriented Programming

## Task

Practice using data structures to build object oriented programs without using
inheritance, but rather composition usage. You will need to refer to
the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/).

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in the [`hw2.go`](/~cis193/homeworks/hw2.go) code file stub.

Be sure that your code is run through `gofmt` and compiles successfully before
submitting. You will be learning many Go best practices throughout the semester
that you will be expected to follow.

## Submitting

You should submit your `hw2.go`
to [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1350686) when you are done.

**NOTE:** Please submit *only* the completed `hw2.go` file, nothing else.
