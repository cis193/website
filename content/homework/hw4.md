# Homework 4: Concurrency

## Task

Begin gaining familiarity with Go-style concurrency primitives. You will need to
refer to the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/).

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in the [`hw4.go`](/~cis193/homeworks/hw4.go) code file stub.

Be sure that your code is run through `gofmt` and compiles successfully before
submitting. You will be learning many Go best practices throughout the semester
that you will be expected to follow.

You can download a test file for Problem 1 here: [`file_sum.txt`](/~cis193/homeworks/file_sum.txt).
The resulting sum for this input should be 42 in both cases.

## Submitting

You should submit your `hw4.go`
to [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1350686) when you are done.

**NOTE:** Please submit *only* the completed `hw4.go` file, nothing else.
