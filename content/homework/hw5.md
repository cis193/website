# Homework 5: Goroutines

## Task

Use goroutines and channels to build sophisticated concurrency primitives. You
will almost certainly need to refer to the [Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/).

## Exercises

Complete the exercises in the [`hw5.go`](/~cis193/homeworks/hw5.go) code file stub.

Make sure that your code does not result in any data races, hanging goroutines,
or use of shared state. Static analysis tools like `go vet` may help.

Be sure that your code is run through `gofmt` and compiles successfully before
submitting. You will be learning many Go best practices throughout the semester
that you will be expected to follow.

## Submitting

You should submit your `hw5.go`
to [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1350686) when you are done.

**NOTE:** Please submit *only* the completed `hw5.go` file, nothing else.
